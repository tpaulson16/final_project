SOLUTION ALGORITHM:

gameRooms =
  Each Game room contains an IF ELSE Example below.

room 1: {name: "Entrance Hall", visits:0, text: Game Text 
  Game Text + input + Game Text
    pull room options: 
    roomKey: "Exit", roomOptionText: Turn Back

      return Game Text
END


deleteRoomOptions
  while roomOptionsElement.firstChild exists
  	remove roomOptionsElement.removeChild(roomOptionsElement.firstChild)
END


UpdateGameElements newRoom
  roomTextElement.textContent = newRoom.GetText from roomOptionText
  CreateRoomOptions for newRoom
END


VisitRoom room
  add 1 visit to room.visits
  UpdateGameElements room
END


RoomOptionClickHandler event
  var optionElementClicked = event.target
  var nextRoomName = optionElementClicked.value
  var nextRoom = gameRooms [nextRoomName]
  VisitRoom nextRoom 
END

CreateRoomOptions room
  deleteRoomOptions
    for var i = 0; i < room.options.length i++
      if(room.options[i].hasOwnProperty "isValid"
        if (room.options[i].isValid() == false
          continue
END


StartGame - run each function together to generate gameroom
  roomElement = document.getElementById room
  roomNameElement = document.getElementById room-name
  roomTextElement = document.getElementById room-text
  roomOptionsElement = document.getElementById("room-options
    var startingRoom = gameRooms [room 1]
  VisitRoom startingRoom
